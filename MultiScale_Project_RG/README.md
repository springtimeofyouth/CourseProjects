## Python code for flow through a porous media

- In the code provided, the velocity u is calculated using an upwind scheme based on the sign of the velocity (u >= 0 or u < 0),
- which determines the direction of the pressure gradient.
- This upwind scheme is used to approximate the spatial derivative of pressure (dp/dx) in Darcy's law,
- and is combined with the porosity âˆ… (phi) and other parameters to assemble a coefficient matrix A and right-hand side b for solving the system of equations
- to obtain the pressure profile p.
