## Using machine learning algorithms to optimize chemical processes by analyzing data from sensors and reactors
Process optimization is crucial for maximizing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving product quality. 
Traditionally, chemical engineers relied on trial-and-error experimentation and manual calculations to optimize chemical processes. 
However, with the rise of big data and machine learning, it has become possible to analyze large amounts of data from sensors, reactors, and other sources to predict optimal reaction conditions 
and identify factors that affect process efficiency.

For the project, some of the necessary features that could be used as input data to train the model include:
a)	Temperature
b)	Pressure
c)	Flow Rate
d)	Concentration
e)	Reactor Size
f)	Catalyst Type
g)	Reaction Time
h)	Product Quality
i)	Density
j)	Viscosity
k)	Solubility


## Objectiveof the project: 
The objective of this project is to develop a model which can predict the yield using all the features involved. As all the data are labelled so it is a regression problem.
## Four Regression models has been developed and trained based on the data provided. 
The models are: 
i.	Multilinear Regression Model
ii.	Support Vector Regression(SVR) Model
iii.	Decision Tree Model 
iv.	Random Forest Model
